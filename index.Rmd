Hello! My name is Alyssa, and I am a master's student in Microbiology at the University of New Hampshire where I work with [Dr. Anna O'Brien](https://amob.github.io/). My research focuses on implementing duckweeds and other aquatic plants as green manure. Specifically, I am interested in the interactions between duckweeds and toxic cyanobacteria that co-occur in the duckweed microbiome, and how these interactions influence the quality and safety of the green manure. Interested in my work? Read more in the "Research" tab! :)
